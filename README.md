CALL FOR PAPERS
---------------------------------

4 page submissions due by Jun 15th, 2020

Healthcare is, traditionally, a knowledge-driven enterprise with an enormous
amount of data - both structured and unstructured. These data can impact
positively on the development of data-driven health care including precision
medicine and precision public health. However, in the era of big data, the
mining of such data in a manner that leads to clinically actionable outcomes
remains a challenge. In recent years, large scale medical/clinical datasets,
such as “omics” data and radiology reports. are increasingly available. We have
also witnessed an increasing number of successful AI/ML applications using such
datasets to address problems such as drug repurposing and preliminary screening
of radiology reports. In this deep learning era, what are the challenges and
opportunities to deploy such solutions in practice? What is the current status
of AI/ML applications in healthcare? Can the different facets of trust and
explanations drive adoption of such methods in practice? Can knowledge-backed
AI lead to more interpretable models? How do data scientists and physicians
apply this knowledge in collaboration to further the field and improve
healthcare? After witnessing so many great achievements from deep learning
lately, we propose to invite world-leading experts from both data science and
healthcare to discuss and debate the path forward for practical applications of
AI/ML in healthcare, including demos, early work, and critiques on various
aspects of actionable and trustworthy AI. More specifically, we plan to attract
high-quality original research from emerging areas with significant
implications in healthcare and invite open discussions on controversial yet
crucial topics regarding healthcare transformation.
