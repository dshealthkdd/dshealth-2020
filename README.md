# DSHealth 2019

2019 KDD Workshop on Applied Data Science for Healthcare: Bridging the Gap between Data and Knowledge.
Anchorage, AK, United States.  
August 5, 2019  

---------------------------------
CALL FOR PAPERS
---------------------------------

4 page submissions due by May 25, 2019

Healthcare is, traditionally, a knowledge-driven enterprise with an enormous
amount of data - both structured and unstructured and these data can impact
positively on the development of data-driven healthcare including precision
medicine. However, in the era of big data, the mining of this data in a manner
that leads to clinically actionable outcomes remains a challenge. In the deep
learning era, is knowledge extraction and modeling (e.g., feature engineering,
label acquisition, and knowledge graphs) still critical? Can state of the art
methods identify disease subtypes Can knowledge-backed AI lead to more
interpretable informatic models? How do data scientists and physicians apply
this knowledge in collaboration to further the field and improve healthcare?
After witnessing so many great achievements from deep learning lately, we
propose to invite world-leading experts from both data science and healthcare
to discuss and debate the relevance and importance of knowledge, in order to
address real challenges and make an impact in healthcare. More specifically, we
plan to attract high-quality original research from emerging areas with
significant implications in healthcare and invite open discussions on
controversial yet crucial topics regarding healthcare transformation.

with special focus on techniques that are aimed at bridging the gap between
data and knowledge.
â€¨
* Knowledge extraction & modeling with rule-based system or deep learning methods
* Word and knowledge embedding techniques 
* Knowledge graph construction, integration, and related mining
* Distill actionable insights from data and knowledge (e.g., expert systems)
* Human-in-the-loop data science and machine learning
* Knowledge transfer and domain adaptation
* Visualization for health knowledge and model interpretation
* Heterogeneous data processing, integration and meta-learning
* Best practice in data science pipeline 
* Open source data science tools for improving model transparency and interpretability
* Innovative evaluation metrics and tools for bias-removal, and fair and comprehensive comparison
* Personalized recommendation systems using literature or patient-generated health data

Papers must be submitted in PDF format to
https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dshealth2019 and formatted according to the
new Standard ACM Conference Proceedings Template. Papers must be a maximum
length of 4 pages, including references.

The program committee will select the papers based on originality,
presentation, and technical quality for spotlight and/or poster presentation.

The best selected student paper and the best paper will be granted with $500
travel grant each. Please indicate whether the primary author is a student in
the easychair submission form.
